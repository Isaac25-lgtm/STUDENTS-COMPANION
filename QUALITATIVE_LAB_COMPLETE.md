**Output:** Documents loaded, ready for coding

### Step 3: Code
**User:** Types "generate codes"
**AI:** Analyzes all documents, generates 10-15 codes
**Output:** Codebook created, codes visible in tab

### Step 4: Categorize
**User:** Types "build themes"
**AI:** Organizes codes into 3-5 themes
**Output:** Thematic map created, themes visible

### Step 5: Analyze
**User:** Reviews themes, asks questions
**AI:** Explains patterns, relationships
**Output:** Analysis insights

### Step 6: Results
**User:** Types "extract quotes" or "write findings"
**AI:** Generates quotes table and/or narrative
**Output:** Complete findings ready

### Step 7: Export
**User:** Clicks "Export Complete Findings Chapter"
**System:** Downloads all-in-one file
**Output:** Thesis-ready chapter

## 📝 Sample Documents

Create test transcripts like:

```txt
Participant 1 - Rural Healthcare Access

Interviewer: What challenges do you face accessing healthcare?

Participant: The biggest problem is distance. The nearest clinic is 15 kilometers away. During rainy season, the road becomes impassable. I have to wait until it dries before I can seek care, even if I'm very sick.

Interviewer: What about the cost?

Participant: The consultation fee is manageable, but the medicine costs are too high. Sometimes I can't afford to buy all the prescribed drugs, so I only buy what I can afford and hope it will work.

Interviewer: How would you describe your experience at the clinic?

Participant: The nurses are often overwhelmed. They seem frustrated and don't take time to explain things properly. I leave without understanding my condition or how to take the medicine correctly.
```

This allows testing realistic qualitative analysis.
